Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 11. Hud, Ayah 28

قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّي وَآتَانِي رَحْمَةً مِنْ عِنْدِهِ فَعُمِّيَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنُلْزِمُكُمُوهَا وَأَنْتُمْ لَهَا كَارِهُونَ٢٨
28. He said: "O my people! Tell me, if I have a clear proof from my Lord, and a mercy (prophethood) has come to me from Him, but that (mercy) has been obscured from your sight. Shall we compel you (to accept) it when you have a strong hatred for it

The Response of Nuh

Allah says, informing about the response of Nuh to his people,

﴿أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَى بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّى﴾
(Tell me, if I have a clear proof from my Lord,) Bayyinah means certainty, a clear matter, and truthful prophethood. That is the greatest mercy from Allah upon him (Nuh) and them (his people).

﴿فَعُمِّيَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ﴾
(but that (mercy) has been obscured from your sight.) "Obscured from your sight'' in this verse means, `it was hidden from you and you are not guided to it. Thus, you ﴿people﴾ did not know its importance so you hastily rejected and denied it.'

﴿أَنُلْزِمُكُمُوهَا﴾
(Shall we compel you (to accept) it) This means, "Should we force you to accept it, while you actually detest it.''
