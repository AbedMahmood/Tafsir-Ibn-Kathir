Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 103. Al-Asr, Ayaat 1 To 3

وَالْعَصْرِ١إِنَّ الْإِنْسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ٢إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ٣
1. By Al-`Asr. 2. Verily, man is in loss. 3. Except those who believe and do righteous deeds, and recommend one another to the truth, and recommend one another to patience.

Al-`Asr is the time in which the movements of the Children of Adam occur, whether good or evil.

Malik narrated from Zayd bin Aslam that he said, "It is the evening.'' However, the first view is the popular opinion. Thus, Allah swears by this, that man is in Khusr, which means in loss and destruction.

﴿إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ﴾
(Except those who believe and do righteous good deeds) So Allah makes an exception, among the species of man being in loss, for those who believe in their hearts and work righteous deeds with their limbs.

﴿وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالْحَقِّ﴾
(And recommend one another to the truth,) This is to perform acts of obedience and avoid the forbidden things.

﴿وَتَوَاصَوْاْ بِالصَّبْرِ﴾
(And recommend one another to patience.) meaning, with the plots, the evils, and the harms of those who harm people due to their commanding them to do good and forbidding them from evil. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-`Asr, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.
