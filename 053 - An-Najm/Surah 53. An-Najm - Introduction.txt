Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 53. An-Najm, Introduction

Introduction to Najm
Which was revealed in Makkah

The First Surah in which a Prostration is revealed

Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah ﴿bin Mas`ud﴾ said, "Surat An-Najm was the first Surah in which a prostration was revealed. The Prophet (recited it in Makkah) and prostrated. Those who were with him did the same, except an old man who took a handful of soil and prostrated on it. Later on, I saw him killed as a disbeliever; he was Umayyah bin Khalaf.'' Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in several places of his Sahih, as did Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i, using various chains of narration through Abu Ishaq from `Abdullah.
