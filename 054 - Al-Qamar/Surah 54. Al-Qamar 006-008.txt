Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 54. Al-Qamar, Ayaat 6 To 8

فَتَوَلَّ عَنْهُمْ ۘ يَوْمَ يَدْعُ الدَّاعِ إِلَىٰ شَيْءٍ نُكُرٍ٦خُشَّعًا أَبْصَارُهُمْ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الْأَجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُنْتَشِرٌ٧مُهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ ۖ يَقُولُ الْكَافِرُونَ هَٰذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ٨
6. So withdraw from them. The Day that the caller will call (them) to a terrible thing. 7. They will come forth, with humbled eyes from (their) graves as if they were locusts spread abroad, 8. Hastening towards the caller. The disbelievers will say: "This is a hard Day.''

The terrible End the Disbelievers will meet on the Day of Resurrection

Allah the Exalted says, `O Muhammad, turn away from these people who, when they witness a miracle, they deny it and say that this is continuous magic.' Turn away from them and wait until,

﴿يَوْمَ يَدْعُو الدَّاعِ إِلَى شَىْءٍ نُّكُرٍ﴾
(The Day that the caller will call (them) to a terrible thing.) to the Recompense and the afflictions, horrors and tremendous hardships that it brings forth,

﴿خُشَّعاً أَبْصَـرُهُمْ﴾
(with humbled eyes), their eyes will be covered with disgrace,

﴿يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الاٌّجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ﴾
(they will come forth from (their) graves as if they were locusts spread abroad.) They will gather towards the area of Reckoning in such haste and crowds, in response to the caller, as if they were crowds of locusts spreading all about. Allah said,

﴿مُهْطِعِينَ﴾
(Hastening) meaing hurriedly,

﴿إِلَى الدَّاعِ﴾
(towards the caller.) without being able to hesitate or slow down,

﴿يَقُولُ الْكَـفِرُونَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ﴾
(The disbelievers will say: "This is a hard Day.''), meaing, `this is a hard, terrible, horrifying and distressful Day,'

﴿فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ ﴾
(Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -- far from easy for the dis- believers.) (74:9-10)
