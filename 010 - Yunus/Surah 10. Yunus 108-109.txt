Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 10. Yunus, Ayaat 108 To 109

قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَاءَكُمُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ ۖ فَمَنِ اهْتَدَىٰ فَإِنَّمَا يَهْتَدِي لِنَفْسِهِ ۖ وَمَنْ ضَلَّ فَإِنَّمَا يَضِلُّ عَلَيْهَا ۖ وَمَا أَنَا عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ١٠٨وَاتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ وَاصْبِرْ حَتَّىٰ يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ ۚ وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْحَاكِمِينَ١٠٩
108. Say: "O people! Now the truth has come to you from your Lord. So whoever receives guidance, he does so for the good of himself. And whoever goes astray, he does so at his own loss. And I am not set over you as a guardian. 109. And follow what is revealed to you, and be patient until Allah gives judgment. And He is the best of the judges.) Allah, the Exalted, commands His Messenger to inform the people that that which he has brought them from Allah is the truth. It is a message concerning which there is no doubt or suspicion. Therefore, whoever is guided by it and follows it, then he only benefits himself by doing so. Likewise, whoever is misguided away from this message, then he will suffer the consequences against his own self.

﴿وَمَآ أَنَاْ عَلَيْكُمْ بِوَكِيلٍ﴾
(And I am not set over you as a guardian) This means, `I am not a guardian over you in order for you to become believers. I am only a warner to you and guidance belongs to Allah, the Exalted.' Concerning Allah's statement,

﴿وَاتَّبِعْ مَا يُوحَى إِلَيْكَ وَاصْبِرْ﴾
(And follow what has been revealed to you, and be patient) This means, `Adhere to that which Allah has revealed to you, and inspired you with, and be patient with the opposition that you meet from the people.'

﴿حَتَّى يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ﴾
(until Allah gives judgment) This means, `Until Allah judges between you and them.'

﴿وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْحَـكِمِينَ﴾
(And He is the best of judges. ) This means that He is the best of those who pass judgment, due to His Justice and His wisdom.
