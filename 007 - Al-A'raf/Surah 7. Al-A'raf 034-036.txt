Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 7. Al-A'raf, Ayaat 34 To 36

وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ أَجَلٌ ۖ فَإِذَا جَاءَ أَجَلُهُمْ لَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً ۖ وَلَا يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ٣٤يَا بَنِي آدَمَ إِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ رُسُلٌ مِنْكُمْ يَقُصُّونَ عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِي ۙ فَمَنِ اتَّقَىٰ وَأَصْلَحَ فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ٣٥وَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَاسْتَكْبَرُوا عَنْهَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ ۖ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ٣٦
34. And every Ummah has its appointed term; when their term comes, neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment). 35. O Children of Adam! If there come to you Messengers from among you, reciting to you My Ayat, then whosoever has Taqwa and becomes righteous, on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve. 36. But those who reject Our Ayat and treat them with arrogance, they are the dwellers of the Fire, they will abide therein forever.) Allah said,

﴿وَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ﴾
(And every Ummah has), meaning, each generation and nation,

﴿أَجَلٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ أَجَلُهُمْ﴾
(its appointed term; when their term comes) which they were destined for,

﴿لاَ يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً وَلاَ يَسْتَقْدِمُونَ﴾
(neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment)). Allah then warned the Children of Adam that He sent to them Messengers who conveyed to them His Ayat. Allah also conveyed good news, as well as warning,

﴿فَمَنِ اتَّقَى وَأَصْلَحَ﴾
(then whosoever has Taqwa and becomes righteous) by abandoning the prohibitions and performing acts of obedience,

﴿فَلاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَوَالَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ عَنْهَآ﴾
(on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve. But those who reject Our Ayat and treat them with arrogance,) meaning, their hearts denied the Ayat and they were too arrogant to abide by them,

﴿أُولَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ﴾
(they are the dwellers of the Fire, they will abide therein forever.) without end to their dwelling in it.
