Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 17. Al-Israa, Ayah 69

أَمْ أَمِنْتُمْ أَنْ يُعِيدَكُمْ فِيهِ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ فَيُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ قَاصِفًا مِنَ الرِّيحِ فَيُغْرِقَكُمْ بِمَا كَفَرْتُمْ ۙ ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُوا لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا بِهِ تَبِيعًا٦٩
69. Or do you feel secure that He will not send you back a second time to sea and send against you a Qasif and drown you because of your disbelief Then you will not find any avenger therein against Us.

Perhaps He will send You back to the Sea

Allah says,

﴿أَمْ أَمِنتُمْ﴾
(Or do you feel secure), `you who turn away from Us after acknowledging Our Oneness at sea once you are back upon dry land,'

﴿أَن يُعِيدَكُمْ﴾
(that He will not send you back) to sea a second time

﴿فَيُرْسِلَ عَلَيْكُمْ قَاصِفًا مِّنَ الرِّيحِ﴾
(and send against you a Qasif) which will destroy your masts and sink your vessels. Ibn `Abbas and others said, "Al-Qasif is the wind of the sea which destroys vessels and sinks them.''

﴿فَيُغْرِقَكُم بِمَا كَفَرْتُمْ﴾
(and drown you because of your disbelief) means because of your rejection and turning away from Allah.

﴿ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُواْ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا بِهِ تَبِيعًا﴾
(Then you will not find any avenger therein against Us.) Ibn `Abbas said that this means a helper. Mujahid said, "A helper who will avenge you,'' i.e., take revenge on your behalf. Qatadah said it means, "We are not afraid that anyone will pursue Us with anything of that nature (i.e., vengeance).''
