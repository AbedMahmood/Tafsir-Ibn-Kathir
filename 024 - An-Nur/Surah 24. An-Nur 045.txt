Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 24. An-Nur, Ayah 45

وَاللَّهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَابَّةٍ مِنْ مَاءٍ ۖ فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ بَطْنِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ رِجْلَيْنِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَمْشِي عَلَىٰ أَرْبَعٍ ۚ يَخْلُقُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ٤٥
45. Allah has created every moving creature from water. Of them there are some that creep on their bellies, and some that walk on two legs, and some that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills. Verily, Allah is able to do all things.

Allah's Power in His creation of the Animals

Allah mentions His complete and almighty power to create all the different kinds of animals with their various forms, colors and ways of moving and stopping, from one kind of water.

﴿فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَى بَطْنِهِ﴾
(Of them there are some that creep on their bellies,) like snakes and so on;

﴿وَمِنهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَى رِجْلَيْنِ﴾
(and some that walk on two legs,) like humans and birds;

﴿وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَمْشِى عَلَى أَرْبَعٍ﴾
(and some that walk on four,) like cattle and all kinds of animals. Allah says:

﴿يَخْلُقُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ﴾
(Allah creates what He wills.) meaning by His power, because what He wills happens and what He does not will does not happen. So he says:

﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ﴾
(Verily, Allah is able to do all things.)
