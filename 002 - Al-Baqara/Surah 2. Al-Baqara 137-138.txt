Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 2. Al-Baqara, Ayaat 137 To 138

فَإِنْ آمَنُوا بِمِثْلِ مَا آمَنْتُمْ بِهِ فَقَدِ اهْتَدَوْا ۖ وَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّمَا هُمْ فِي شِقَاقٍ ۖ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ اللَّهُ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ١٣٧صِبْغَةَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ مِنَ اللَّهِ صِبْغَةً ۖ وَنَحْنُ لَهُ عَابِدُونَ١٣٨
137. So if they believe in the like of that which you believe then they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, then they are only in opposition. So Allah will suffice for you against them. And He is the Hearer, the Knower. 138. Our Sibghah (religion) is ﴾the Sibghah of Allah (Islam) and which Sibghah can be better than Allah's And we are His worshippers.

Allah said, if they, the disbelievers among the People of the Book and other disbelievers, believe in all of Allah's Books and Messengers and do not differentiate between any of them,

﴿فَقَدِ اهْتَدَواْ﴾
(then they are rightly guided) meaning, they would acquire the truth and be directed to it.

﴿وَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ﴾
(but if they turn away) from truth to falsehood after proof had been presented to them,

﴿فَإِنَّمَا هُمْ فِى شِقَاقٍ فَسَيَكْفِيكَهُمُ اللَّهُ﴾
(then they are only in opposition. So Allah will suffice you against them) meaning, Allah will aid the believers against them,

﴿وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ﴾
(And He is the Hearer, the Knower). Allah said,

﴿صِبْغَةَ اللَّهِ﴾
(The Sibghah of Allah). Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas commented, "The religion of Allah.'' This Tafsir was also reported of Mujahid, Abu Al-`Aliyah, `Ikrimah, Ibrahim, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, `Abdullah bin Kathir, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and other scholars. The Ayah,

﴿فِطْرَةَ اللَّهِ﴾
(Allah's Fitrah (i.e. Allah's Islamic Monotheism)) (30:30) directs Muslims to, "Hold to it.''
