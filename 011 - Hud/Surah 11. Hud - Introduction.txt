Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 11. Hud, Introduction

Introduction to Hud
Which was revealed in Makkah
Surah Hud made the Prophet's Hair turn Gray

Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi recorded from Ibn `Abbas that Abu Bakr said, "O Messenger of Allah, verily your hair has turned gray.'' The Prophet replied,

«شَيَّبَتْنِي هُودٌ وَالْوَاقِعَةُ وَالْمُرْسَلَاتُ وَعَمَّ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ وَإِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَت»
(Surahs Hud, Al-Waqi`ah, Al-Mursalat, `Amma Yatasa'lun ﴿An-Naba'﴾ and Idhash-Shamsu Kuwwirat ﴿At-Takwir﴾ have turned my hair gray.) In another narration he said,

«هُودٌ وَأَخَوَاتُهَا»
(Surah Hud and its sisters...)

﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴾
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
