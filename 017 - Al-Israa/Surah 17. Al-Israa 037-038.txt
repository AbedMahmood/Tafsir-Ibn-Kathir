Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 17. Al-Israa, Ayaat 37 To 38

وَلَا تَمْشِ فِي الْأَرْضِ مَرَحًا ۖ إِنَّكَ لَنْ تَخْرِقَ الْأَرْضَ وَلَنْ تَبْلُغَ الْجِبَالَ طُولًا٣٧كُلُّ ذَٰلِكَ كَانَ سَيِّئُهُ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ مَكْرُوهًا٣٨
37. And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth nor can you attain a stature like the mountains in height. 38. All the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord.

Condemnation of strutting

Allah forbids His servants to strut and walk in a boastful manner:

﴿وَلاَ تَمْشِ فِى الاٌّرْضِ مَرَحًا﴾
(And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance.) meaning, walking in boastful manner and acting proud, like those who are arrogant oppressors.

﴿إِنَّكَ لَن تَخْرِقَ الاٌّرْضَ﴾
(Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth) means, you cannot penetrate the earth with your walking. This was the opinion of Ibn Jarir.
