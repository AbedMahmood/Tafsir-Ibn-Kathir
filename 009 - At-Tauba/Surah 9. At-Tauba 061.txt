Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 9. At-Tauba, Ayah 61

وَمِنْهُمُ الَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ النَّبِيَّ وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ أُذُنٌ ۚ قُلْ أُذُنُ خَيْرٍ لَكُمْ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَرَحْمَةٌ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مِنْكُمْ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ٦١
61. And among them are men who annoy the Prophet and say: "He is (lending his) ear (to every news).'' Say: "He listens to what is best for you; he believes in Allah; has faith in the believers; and is a mercy to those of you who believe.'' But those who annoy Allah's Messenger, will have a painful torment.

Hypocrites annoy the Prophet

Allah says, some hypocrites bother the Messenger of Allah by questioning his character, saying,

﴿هُوَ أُذُنٌ﴾
(he is (lending his) ear), to those who say anything about us; he believes whoever talks to him. Therefore, if we went to him and swore, he would believe us. Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. Allah said,

﴿قُلْ أُذُنُ خَيْرٍ لَّكُمْ﴾
(Say: "He listens to what is best for you''), he knows who's saying the truth and who is lying,

﴿يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ﴾
(he believes in Allah; has faith in the believers), he believes the believers,

﴿وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ﴾
(and is a mercy to those of you who believe''), and a proof against the disbelievers,

﴿وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ﴾
(But those who annoy Allah's Messenger, will have a painful torment.)
