Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 7. Al-A'raf, Ayah 93

فَتَوَلَّىٰ عَنْهُمْ وَقَالَ يَا قَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَالَاتِ رَبِّي وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ ۖ فَكَيْفَ آسَىٰ عَلَىٰ قَوْمٍ كَافِرِينَ٩٣
93. Then he (Shu`ayb) turned from them and said: "O my people! I have indeed conveyed my Lord's Messages unto you and I have given you good advice. Then how can I grieve over people who are disbelievers.'') Prophet Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, turned away from his people after the torment, punishment and destruction struck them, admonishing and censuring them by saying to them,

﴿يَقَوْمِ لَقَدْ أَبْلَغْتُكُمْ رِسَـلَـتِ رَبِّى وَنَصَحْتُ لَكُمْ﴾
("O my people! I have indeed conveyed my Lord's Messages unto you and I have given you good advice.'') Shu`ayb said, I have conveyed to you what I was sent with, so I will not feel any sorrow for you since you disbelieved in what I brought you,

﴿فَكَيْفَ ءَاسَى عَلَى قَوْمٍ كَـفِرِينَ﴾
("Then how can I grieve over pepple who are disbelievers'')
