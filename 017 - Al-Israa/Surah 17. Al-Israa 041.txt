Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 17. Al-Israa, Ayah 41

وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا فِي هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنِ لِيَذَّكَّرُوا وَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلَّا نُفُورًا٤١
41. And surely, We have explained in this Qur'an that they may take heed, but it increases them in naught save aversion.) Allah says:

﴿وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا فِى هَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ﴾
(And surely, We have explained in this Qur'an) meaning, `We have explained Our warni- ngs so that they may remember the proof, evidence and exhorta- tions contained there- in, and be prevented from Shirk, wrong- doing and scandal.'

﴿وَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ﴾
(but it increases them in naught) the wrong- doers among them

﴿إِلاَّ نُفُورًا﴾
(save aversion.) aversion towards the truth; they go further away from it.
