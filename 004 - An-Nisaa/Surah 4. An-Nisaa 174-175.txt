Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 4. An-Nisaa, Ayaat 174 To 175

يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بُرْهَانٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ وَأَنْزَلْنَا إِلَيْكُمْ نُورًا مُبِينًا١٧٤فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَاعْتَصَمُوا بِهِ فَسَيُدْخِلُهُمْ فِي رَحْمَةٍ مِنْهُ وَفَضْلٍ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَيْهِ صِرَاطًا مُسْتَقِيمًا١٧٥
174. O mankind! Verily, there has come to you a convincing proof from your Lord; and We sent down to you a manifest light. 175. So, as for those who believed in Allah and held fast to ﴿depend on﴾ Him, He will admit them to His mercy and grace (i.e. Paradise), and guide them to Himself by a straight path.

The Description of the Revelation that Came From Allah

Allah informs all people that a plain, unequivocal proof has come to them from Him. One that eradicates all possibility of having an excuse, or falling prey to evil doubts. Allah said,

﴿وَأَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ نُوراً مُّبِيناً﴾
(and We sent down to you a manifest light.) that directs to the Truth. Ibn Jurayj and others said, "It is the Qur'an.''

﴿فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَاعْتَصَمُواْ بِهِ﴾
(So, as for those who believed in Allah and held fast to ﴿depend on﴾ Him,) by worshipping Him and relying on Him for each and every thing. Ibn Jurayj said that this part of the Ayah means, "They believe in Allah and hold fast to the Qur'an.''

﴿فَسَيُدْخِلُهُمْ فِى رَحْمَةٍ مَّنْهُ وَفَضْلٍ﴾
(He will admit them to His mercy and grace,) meaning, He will grant them His mercy and admit them into Paradise, and will increase and multiply their rewards and their ranks, as a favor and bounty from Him.

﴿وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَيْهِ صِرَطاً مُّسْتَقِيماً﴾
(and guide them to Himself by a straight path.) and a clear way that has no wickedness in it or deviation. This, indeed, is the description of the believers in this life and the Hereafter, as they are on the straight and safe path in matters of action and creed. In the Hereafter, they are on the straight path of Allah that leads to the gardens of Paradise.
