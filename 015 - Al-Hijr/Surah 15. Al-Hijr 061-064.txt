Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 15. Al-Hijr, Ayaat 61 To 64

فَلَمَّا جَاءَ آلَ لُوطٍ الْمُرْسَلُونَ٦١قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ مُنْكَرُونَ٦٢قَالُوا بَلْ جِئْنَاكَ بِمَا كَانُوا فِيهِ يَمْتَرُونَ٦٣وَأَتَيْنَاكَ بِالْحَقِّ وَإِنَّا لَصَادِقُونَ٦٤
61. Then when the messengers (the angels) came to the family of Lut 62. He (Lut) said: "Verily, you are people unknown to me.'' 63. They said: "Nay, we have come to you with that (torment) which they have been doubting.'' 64. "And we have brought you the truth and certainly we tell the truth.''

The Angels coming to Lut

Allah tells us about when the angels came to Lut in the form of young men with handsome faces. When they entered his home, he said:

﴿قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ مُّنكَرُونَ - قَالُواْ بَلْ جِئْنَـكَ بِمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَمْتَرُونَ ﴾
("Verily, you are people unknown to me.'' They said: "Nay, we have come to you with that (torment) which they have been doubting.'') meaning that they were bringing the punishment and destruction that the people doubted they would ever suffer from.

﴿وَآتَيْنَـكَ بِالْحَقِّ﴾
(And we have brought you the truth) is like the Ayah,

﴿مَا نُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِلاَّ بِالحَقِّ﴾
(We do not send the angels down except with the truth) ﴿15:8﴾ and

﴿وِإِنَّا لَصَـدِقُونَ﴾
(and certainly, we tell the truth.) They said this in affirmation of the news that they brought him, that he would be saved and his people would be destroyed.
