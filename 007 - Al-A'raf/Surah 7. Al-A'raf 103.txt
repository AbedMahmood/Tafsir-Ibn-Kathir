Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 7. Al-A'raf, Ayah 103

ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ مُوسَىٰ بِآيَاتِنَا إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلَئِهِ فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا ۖ فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُفْسِدِينَ١٠٣
103. Then after them We sent Musa with Our signs to Fir`awn and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. So see how was the end of the mischief-makers

Story of Prophet Musa, upon him be Peace, and Fir`awn

Allah said,

﴿ثُمَّ بَعَثْنَا مِن بَعْدِهِم﴾
(Then after them We sent), after the Messengers whom We mentioned, such as Nuh, Hud, Salih Lut and Shu`ayb (may Allah's peace and blessings be on them and the rest of Allah's Prophets), We sent,

﴿مُّوسَى بِـَايَـتِنَآ﴾
(Musa with Our signs) proofs and clear evidences, to Fir`awn, who was ruler of Egypt during the time of Musa,

﴿وَمَلإِيْهِ﴾
(and his chiefs) the people of Fir`awn,

﴿فَظَلَمُواْ بِهَا﴾
(but they wrongfully rejected them), they denied and disbelieved in the signs, out of injustice and stubbornness on their part. Allah said about them in another Ayah,

﴿وَجَحَدُواْ بِهَا وَاسْتَيْقَنَتْهَآ أَنفُسُهُمْ ظُلْماً وَعُلُوّاً فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُفْسِدِينَ ﴾
(And they belied them (those Ayat) wrongfully and arrogantly, though they were themselves convinced thereof. So see what was the end of the evildoers.)﴿27:14﴾ The Ayah says, `those who hindered from the path of Allah and belied in His Messengers, look how We punished them, We caused them to drown, all of them, while Musa and his people were watching.' Public drowning added disgrace to the punishment that Fir`awn and his people suffered, while adding comfort to the hearts of Allah's party, Musa and those people who believed in him.
