Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 35. Fatir, Ayaat 29 To 30

إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَتْلُونَ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَأَنْفَقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاهُمْ سِرًّا وَعَلَانِيَةً يَرْجُونَ تِجَارَةً لَنْ تَبُورَ٢٩لِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزِيدَهُمْ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ٣٠
29. Verily, those who recite the Book of Allah, and perform the Salah, and spend out of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, they hope for a (sure) trade-gain that will never perish. 30. That He may pay them their wages in full, and give them (even) more, out of His grace. Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate.

The Muslims will be the Ones Who gain in the Hereafter

Here Allah tells us that His believing servants, who recite and believe in His Book, and do the deeds prescribed in it such as establishing regular prayer at the prescribed times, night and day, spending (in charity) out of that which Allah has provided for them secretly and openly,

﴿يَرْجُونَ تِجَـرَةً لَّن تَبُورَ﴾
(they hope for a (sure) trade-gain that will never perish.) means, they hope for a reward from Allah which will inevitably be theirs. Allah says:

﴿لِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزِيدَهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِ﴾
(That He may pay them their wages in full, and give them (even) more, out of His grace.) meaning, that He may give them a reward for what they have done, and multiply it by adding more, such as has never occurred to them.

﴿إِنَّهُ غَفُورٌ﴾
(Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving,) means, He forgives their sins,

﴿شَكُورٍ﴾
(Most Ready to appreciate.) means, He appreciates even a little of their good deeds.
