Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 15. Al-Hijr, Ayaat 14 To 15

وَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ بَابًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَظَلُّوا فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ١٤لَقَالُوا إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَارُنَا بَلْ نَحْنُ قَوْمٌ مَسْحُورُونَ١٥
14. And even if We opened to them a gate to the heavens and they were to continue ascending through it (all day long). 15. They would surely say (in the evening): "Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled (we have not seen any angel or heaven). Nay, we are a people bewitched.''

The Stubborn Disbelievers will never believe, no matter what Signs and Wonders They see

Allah explains the extent of their disbelief and stubborn resistance to the truth by stating that even if a door to heaven were to be opened for them, and they were to be taken up through it, they would still not believe. Rather, they would say:

﴿إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا﴾
(Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled.) Mujahid, Ibn Kathir and Ad-Dahhak said, "﴿this means﴾ our vision has been blocked.'' Qatadah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, "﴿this means﴾ our eyesight has been taken away.'' Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, "﴿this means﴾ we were confused and put under a spell.''

﴿سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا﴾
(Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled.) Ibn Zayd said: "The one who is dazzled ﴿lit. intoxicated﴾ is the one who cannot reason.''
