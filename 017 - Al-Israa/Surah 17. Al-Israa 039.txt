Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 17. Al-Israa, Ayah 39

ذَٰلِكَ مِمَّا أَوْحَىٰ إِلَيْكَ رَبُّكَ مِنَ الْحِكْمَةِ ۗ وَلَا تَجْعَلْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَٰهًا آخَرَ فَتُلْقَىٰ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَلُومًا مَدْحُورًا٣٩
39. This is (part) of Al-Hikmah (wisdom) which your Lord has revealed to you. And set not up with Allah any other god lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected (from Allah's mercy).

Everything previously mentioned is Revelation and Wisdom

Allah says: `What We have commanded you to do is part of good manners, and what We have forbidden you are evil qualities. We have revealed this to you, O Muhammad, so that you may command the people likewise.'

﴿وَلاَ تَجْعَلْ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهًا ءَاخَرَ فَتُلْقَى فِى جَهَنَّمَ مَلُومًا﴾
(And set not up with Allah any other god lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy) meaning, your own self will blame you, as will Allah and His creation.

﴿مَّدْحُورًا﴾
(rejected) means far removed from everything good. Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah said: "(It means) cast out.'' This is an address to the Ummah via the Messenger , for he is infallible.
