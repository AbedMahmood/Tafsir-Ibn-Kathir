Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 8. Al-Anfal, Ayah 52

كَدَأْبِ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ ۙ وَالَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِهِمْ ۚ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ فَأَخَذَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِيٌّ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ٥٢
52. Similar to the behavior of the people of Fir`awn, and of those before them -- they rejected the Ayat of Allah, so Allah punished them for their sins. Verily, Allah is All-Strong, severe in punishment.

Allah says, `The behavior of these rebellious disbelievers against what I sent you with, O Muhammad, is similar to the behavior of earlier disbelieving nations. So We behaved with them according to Our Da'b, that is, Our behavior ﴿or custom﴾ and way, as We did with them with what We often do and decide concerning their likes, the denying people of Fir`awn and the earlier nations who rejected the Messengers and disbelieved in Our Ayat,'

﴿فَأَخَذَهُمُ اللَّهُ بِذُنُوبِهِمْ﴾
(so Allah punished them for their sins.)

Because of their sins, Allah destroyed them

﴿إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ﴾
(Verily, Allah is All-Strong, severe in punishment.)

None can resist Him or escape His grasp.
