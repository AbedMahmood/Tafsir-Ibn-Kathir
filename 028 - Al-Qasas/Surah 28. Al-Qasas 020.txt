Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 28. Al-Qasas, Ayah 20

وَجَاءَ رَجُلٌ مِنْ أَقْصَى الْمَدِينَةِ يَسْعَىٰ قَالَ يَا مُوسَىٰ إِنَّ الْمَلَأَ يَأْتَمِرُونَ بِكَ لِيَقْتُلُوكَ فَاخْرُجْ إِنِّي لَكَ مِنَ النَّاصِحِينَ٢٠
20. And there came a man running, from the farthest end of the city. He said: "O Musa! Verily, the chiefs are taking counsel together about you, to kill you, so escape. Truly, I am one of the good advisers to you.''

﴿وَجَآءَ رَجُلٌ﴾
(And there came a man) He is described as being a man because he had the courage to take a different route, a shorter route than those who were sent after Musa, so he reached Musa first and said to him: "O Musa,

﴿إِنَّ الْمَلاّ يَأْتَمِرُونَ بِكَ﴾
(Verily, the chiefs are taking counsel together about you.),'' meaning, `they are consulting with one another about you.'

﴿لِيَقْتُلُوكَ فَاخْرُجْ﴾
(to kill you, so escape.) means, from this land.

﴿إِنِّى لَكَ مِنَ النَّـصِحِينَ﴾
(Truly, I am one of the good advisers to you.)
