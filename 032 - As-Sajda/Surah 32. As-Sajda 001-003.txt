Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 32. As-Sajda, Ayaat 1 To 3

الم١تَنْزِيلُ الْكِتَابِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ مِنْ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ٢أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ ۚ بَلْ هُوَ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ لِتُنْذِرَ قَوْمًا مَا أَتَاهُمْ مِنْ نَذِيرٍ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ٣
1. Alif Lam Mim. 2. The revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt, is from the Lord of all that exists. 3. Or say they: "He has fabricated it'' Nay, it is the truth from your Lord, so that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, in order that they may be guided.

The Qur'an is the Book of Allah in which there is no Doubt

We discussed the individual letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah, and there is no need to repeat it here.

﴿تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ﴾
(The revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt,) means, there is no doubt whatsoever that it has been revealed

﴿مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ﴾
(from the Lord of all that exists.) Then Allah tells us about the idolators:

﴿أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ﴾
(Or say they: "He has fabricated it''): they say, he has fabricated it, i.e., he has made it up by himself.

﴿بَلْ هُوَ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أَتَـهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ﴾
(Nay, it is the truth from your Lord, so that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, in order that they may be guided.) means, in order that they may follow the truth.
