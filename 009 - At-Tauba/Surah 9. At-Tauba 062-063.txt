Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 9. At-Tauba, Ayaat 62 To 63

يَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ لَكُمْ لِيُرْضُوكُمْ وَاللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَحَقُّ أَنْ يُرْضُوهُ إِنْ كَانُوا مُؤْمِنِينَ٦٢أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُوا أَنَّهُ مَنْ يُحَادِدِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَأَنَّ لَهُ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدًا فِيهَا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الْخِزْيُ الْعَظِيمُ٦٣
62. They swear by Allah to you (Muslims) in order to please you, but it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger, if they are believers. 63. Know they not that whoever opposes and shows hostility to Allah and His Messenger, certainly for him will be the fire of Hell to abide therein. That is the extreme disgrace.

Hypocrites revert to Lies to please People

Qatadah said about Allah's statement,

﴿يَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ لَكُمْ لِيُرْضُوكُمْ﴾
(They swear by Allah to you (Muslims) in order to please you) "A hypocrite man said, `By Allah! They (hypocrites) are our chiefs and masters. If what Muhammad says is true, they are worse than donkeys.' A Muslim man heard him and declared, `By Allah! What Muhammad says is true and you are worse than a donkey!' The Muslim man conveyed what happened to the Prophet who summoned the hypocrite and asked him,

«مَا حَمَلَكَ عَلَى الَّذِي قُلْتَ؟»
(What made you say what you said) That man invoked curses on himself and swore by Allah that he never said that. Meanwhile, the Muslim man said, `O Allah! Assert the truth of the truthful and expose the lies of the liar.' Allah revealed this Verse.''' Allah's statement,

﴿أَلَمْ يَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّهُ مَن يُحَادِدِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ﴾
(Know they not that whoever opposes and shows hostility to Allah and His Messenger,) means, have they not come to know and realize that those who defy, oppose, wage war and reject Allah, thus becoming on one side while Allah and His Messenger on another side,

﴿فَأَنَّ لَهُ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ خَالِداً فِيهَا﴾
(certainly for him will be the fire of Hell to abide therein), in a humiliating torment,

﴿ذَلِكَ الْخِزْىُ الْعَظِيمُ﴾
(That is the extreme disgrace)﴿9:63﴾, that is the greatest disgrace and the tremendous misery.
