Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 10. Yunus, Ayaat 55 To 56

أَلَا إِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۗ أَلَا إِنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ٥٥هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ٥٦
55. No doubt, surely, all that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. No doubt, surely, Allah's promise is true. But most of them know not. 56. It is He Who gives life, and causes death, and to Him you (all) shall return.) Allah is the Owner of the heavens and earth. His promise is true and is indeed going to be fulfilled. He is the One Who gives life and causes death. To Him is the return of everyone, and He is the One who has the power over that, and the One Who knows everything about every creature; its deterioration, and where every speck of it has gone, be it land, oceans or otherwise.
