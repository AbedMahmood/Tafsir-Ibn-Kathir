Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 9. At-Tauba, Ayaat 88 To 89

لَٰكِنِ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَعَهُ جَاهَدُوا بِأَمْوَالِهِمْ وَأَنْفُسِهِمْ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمُ الْخَيْرَاتُ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ٨٨أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ٨٩
88. But the Messenger and those who believed with him strove hard and fought with their wealth and their lives. Such are they for whom are the good things, and it is they who will be successful. 89. For them Allah has prepared Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.

After Allah mentioned the sins of the hypocrites, He praised the faithful believers and described their reward in the Hereafter,

﴿لَـكِنِ الرَّسُولُ وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ جَـهَدُواْ﴾
(But the Messenger and those who believed with him strove hard and fought) until the end of these two Ayat ﴿9:88-89﴾. This describes the qualities, as well as, the reward of faithful believers. Allah said,

﴿وَأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمُ الْخَيْرَاتُ﴾
(Such are they for whom are the good things), in the Hereafter, in the gardens of Al-Firdaws and the high grades.
