Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 18. Al-Kahf, Ayah 54

وَلَقَدْ صَرَّفْنَا فِي هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنِ لِلنَّاسِ مِنْ كُلِّ مَثَلٍ ۚ وَكَانَ الْإِنْسَانُ أَكْثَرَ شَيْءٍ جَدَلًا٥٤
54. And indeed We have given every kind of example in this Qur'an for mankind. But, man is ever more quarrelsome than anything.

Examples put forth in the Qur'an

Allah says, `In this Qur'an, We have explained to mankind and given clear details of matters so that they will not stray from the truth or be misled from the path of guidance. Despite this explanation, man is very quarrelsome and opposes truth with falsehood,' except for those whom Allah guides to the path of salvation. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Messenger of Allah came to visit him and Fatimah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger at night, and said,

«أَلَا تُصَلِّيَانِ؟»
(Are you not going to pray) I said, "O Messenger of Allah, our souls are in the Hand of Allah. If He wills to wake us, He will wake us.'' When I said that, he went away without returning. Then I heard him as he was walking away, slapping his thigh and saying,

﴿وَكَانَ الإِنْسَـنُ أَكْثَرَ شَىءٍ جَدَلاً﴾
(But, man is ever more quarrelsome than anything.)'' It was also recorded in the Two Sahihs.
