Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 26. Ash-Shu'araa, Ayaat 141 To 145

كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ١٤١إِذْ قَالَ لَهُمْ أَخُوهُمْ صَالِحٌ أَلَا تَتَّقُونَ١٤٢إِنِّي لَكُمْ رَسُولٌ أَمِينٌ١٤٣فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُونِ١٤٤وَمَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مِنْ أَجْرٍ ۖ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلَّا عَلَىٰ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ١٤٥
141. Thamud denied the Messengers. 142. When their brother Salih said to them: "Will you not have Taqwa'' 143. "I am a trustworthy Messenger to you.'' 144. "So, have Taqwa of Allah, and obey me.'' 145. "No reward do I ask of you for it; my reward is only from the Lord of Al-`Alamin.''

Salih and the People of Thamud

Here Allah tells us about His servant and Messenger Salih, whom He sent to his people Thamud. They were Arabs living in the city of Al-Hijr -- which is between Wadi Al-Qura and Greater Syria. Their location is well known. In our explanation of Surat Al-A`raf, we mentioned the Hadiths which tell how the Messenger of Allah passed by their dwelling place when he wanted to launch a raid on Syria. He went as far as Tabuk, then he went back to Al-Madinah to prepare himself for the campaign. Thamud came after `Ad and before Ibrahim, peace be upon him. Their Prophet Salih called them to Allah, to worship Him alone with no partner or associate, and to obey whatever commands were conveyed to them, but they refused, rejecting him and opposing him. He told them that he did not seek any reward from them for his call to them, but that he would seek the reward for that with Allah. Then he reminded them of the blessings of Allah.
