Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 16. An-Nahl, Ayah 76

وَضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا رَجُلَيْنِ أَحَدُهُمَا أَبْكَمُ لَا يَقْدِرُ عَلَىٰ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ كَلٌّ عَلَىٰ مَوْلَاهُ أَيْنَمَا يُوَجِّهْهُ لَا يَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ ۖ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي هُوَ وَمَنْ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ ۙ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ٧٦
76. And Allah gives an example of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power over anything, and he is a burden on his master; whichever way he directs him, he brings no good. Is such a man equal to one who commands justice, and is himself on the straight path

Another Example

Mujahid said, "This also refers to idols and the True God, may He be exalted.'' Meaning that the idol is dumb and cannot speak or say anything, good or otherwise. It cannot do anything at all, no words, no action, it is dependent and is a burden on its master.

﴿أَيْنَمَا يُوَجِّههُّ﴾
(whichever way he directs him,) meaning, wherever he sends him

﴿لاَ يَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ﴾
(he brings no good.) meaning, he does not succeed in what he wants.

﴿هَلْ يَسْتَوِى﴾
(Is such a man equal) meaning, a man who has these attributes

﴿وَمَن يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ﴾
(to one who commands justice) meaning fairness, one whose words are true and whose deeds are righteous.

﴿وَهُوَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ﴾
(and is himself on the straight path) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: "This is also an example of the disbeliever and the believer'', as in the previous Ayah.
