Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 9. At-Tauba, Ayaat 9 To 11

اشْتَرَوْا بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا فَصَدُّوا عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ ۚ إِنَّهُمْ سَاءَ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ٩لَا يَرْقُبُونَ فِي مُؤْمِنٍ إِلًّا وَلَا ذِمَّةً ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُعْتَدُونَ١٠فَإِنْ تَابُوا وَأَقَامُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَوُا الزَّكَاةَ فَإِخْوَانُكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ ۗ وَنُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ١١

(and they hindered men from His way), trying to prevent the believers from following the truth,

﴿إِنَّهُمْ سَآءَ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَلاَ يَرْقُبُونَ فِى مُؤْمِنٍ إِلاًّ وَلاَ ذِمَّةً﴾
(evil indeed is that which they used to do. With regard to a believer, they respect not the ties, either of kinship or of covenant!) ﴿9:9-10﴾. We explained these meanings before, as well as, the meaning of,

(But if they repent, perform the Salah...)
