Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 15. Al-Hijr, Ayaat 57 To 60

قَالَ فَمَا خَطْبُكُمْ أَيُّهَا الْمُرْسَلُونَ٥٧قَالُوا إِنَّا أُرْسِلْنَا إِلَىٰ قَوْمٍ مُجْرِمِينَ٥٨إِلَّا آلَ لُوطٍ إِنَّا لَمُنَجُّوهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ٥٩إِلَّا امْرَأَتَهُ قَدَّرْنَا ۙ إِنَّهَا لَمِنَ الْغَابِرِينَ٦٠
57. He said: "What then is the business for which you have come, O messengers'' 58. They said: "We have been sent to a guilty people.'' 59. "(All) except the family of Lut, all of whom we are to save (from the destruction).'' 60. "Except for his wife, of whom We have decreed that she shall be of those who remain behind.''

The Reason why the Angels came

Allah tells us that after Ibrahim had calmed down from the excitement of this good news, he started to ask them why they had come to him. They said,

﴿إِنَّآ أُرْسِلْنَآ إِلَى قَوْمٍ مُّجْرِمِينَ﴾
(We have been sent to a guilty people.) meaning the people of Lut. They told him that they were going to save the family of Lut from among those people, except for his wife, because she was one of those who were doomed. Thus it was said,

﴿إِلاَّ امْرَأَتَهُ قَدَّرْنَآ إِنَّهَا لَمِنَ الْغَـبِرِينَ ﴾
(Except for his wife, of whom We have decreed that she shall be of those who remain behind.) i.e., she was one of those who would be left behind and will be destroyed.
