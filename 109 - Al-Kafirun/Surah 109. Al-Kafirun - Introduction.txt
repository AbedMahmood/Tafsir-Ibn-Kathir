Introduction to Kaafiruun
Which was revealed in Makkah

The Recitation of these Surahs in the Optional Prayers

It has been confirmed in Sahih Muslim from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah recited this Surah (Al-Kafirun) and

﴿قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ﴾
(Say: "He is Allah One.'') (112:1) in the two Rak`ahs of Tawaf. It is also recorded in Sahih Muslim in a Hadith of Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah recited these two Surahs in the two Rak`ahs (optional prayer) of the Morning prayer. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah recited in the two Rak`ahs before the Morning prayer and the two Rak`ahs after the Sunset prayer on approximately ten or twenty different occasions,

﴿قُلْ يأَيُّهَا الْكَـفِرُونَ ﴾
(Say: "O Al-Kafirun!'') and

﴿قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ﴾
(Say: " He is Allah One.'') (112:1) Ahmad also recorded that Ibn `Umar said, "I watched the Prophet twenty-four or twenty-five times reciting in the two Rak`ahs before the Morning prayer and the two Rak`ahs after the Sunset prayer,

﴿قُلْ يأَيُّهَا الْكَـفِرُونَ ﴾
(Say: "O Al-Kafirun!'') and

﴿قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ﴾
(Say: "He is Allah One.'') (112:1)'' Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said, "I watched the Prophet for a month and he would recite in the two Rak`ahs before the Morning prayer,

﴿قُلْ يأَيُّهَا الْكَـفِرُونَ ﴾
(Say: "O Al-Kafirun.'') and

﴿قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ﴾
(Say: "He is Allah One.'') (112:1)'' This was also recor- ded by At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and An-Nasa'i. At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan.'' It has already been mentioned previously in a Hadith that it (Surat Al-Kafirun) is equivalent to a fourth of the Qur'an and Az-Zalzalah is equivalent to a fourth of the Qur'an.

﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
