Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 7. Al-A'raf, Ayah 32

قُلْ مَنْ حَرَّمَ زِينَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي أَخْرَجَ لِعِبَادِهِ وَالطَّيِّبَاتِ مِنَ الرِّزْقِ ۚ قُلْ هِيَ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا خَالِصَةً يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ نُفَصِّلُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ٣٢
32. Say: "Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His servants, and At-Tayyibat (good things) of sustenance'' Say: "They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection.'' Thus We explain the Ayat in detail for people who have knowledge.

Allah refutes those who prohibit any type of food, drink or clothes according to their own understanding, without relying on what Allah has legislated,

﴿قُلْ﴾
(Say) O Muhammad, to the idolators who prohibit some things out of false opinion and fabrication,

﴿مَنْ حَرَّمَ زِينَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى أَخْرَجَ لِعِبَادِهِ﴾
(Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His servants) meaning, these things were created for those who believe in Allah and worship Him in this life, even though the disbelievers share in these bounties in this life. In the Hereafter, the believers will have all this to themselves and none of the disbelievers will have a share in it, for Paradise is prohibited for the disbelievers.
