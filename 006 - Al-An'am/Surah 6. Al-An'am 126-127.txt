Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 6. Al-An'am, Ayaat 126 To 127

وَهَٰذَا صِرَاطُ رَبِّكَ مُسْتَقِيمًا ۗ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَذَّكَّرُونَ١٢٦۞ لَهُمْ دَارُ السَّلَامِ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَهُوَ وَلِيُّهُمْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ١٢٧
126. And this is the path of your Lord leading straight. We have detailed Our Ayat for a people who take heed. 127. For them will be the abode of peace with their Lord. And He will be their Wali because of what they used to do.) After Allah mentioned the way of those who were themselves led to stray from His path and who hindered others from it, He emphasized the honor of the guidance and religion of truth that He sent His Messenger with. Allah said next,

﴿وَهَـذَا صِرَطُ رَبِّكَ مُسْتَقِيماً﴾
(And this is the path of your Lord leading straight.) that is, Islam, that We have legislated for you, O Muhammad, by revealing this Qur'an to you, is Allah's straight path.

﴿قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا الآيَـتِ﴾
(We have detailed Our Ayat...) We have explained the Ayat and made them clear and plain,

﴿لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ﴾
(for a people who take heed) those who have sound comprehension and understand what Allah and His Messenger convey to them,

﴿لَهُمْ دَارُ السَّلَـمِ﴾
(For them will be the abode of peace) Paradise,

﴿عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ﴾
(with their Lord.) on the Day of Resurrection. Allah described Paradise as `the abode of peace', because its residents are safe due to their access to the straight path, which conforms to the way of the Prophets. And just as their way was not wicked, they earned the abode of peace ﴿which is free from all wickedness﴾.

﴿وَهُوَ وَلِيُّهُم﴾
(And He will be their Wali) Protector, Supporter and Helper,

﴿بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ﴾
(because of what they used to do,) As reward for their good deeds, Allah has favored them and been generous with them, and awarded them Paradise.
