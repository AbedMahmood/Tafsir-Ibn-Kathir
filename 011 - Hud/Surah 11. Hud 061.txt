Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 11. Hud, Ayah 61

۞ وَإِلَىٰ ثَمُودَ أَخَاهُمْ صَالِحًا ۚ قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُ ۖ هُوَ أَنْشَأَكُمْ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ وَاسْتَعْمَرَكُمْ فِيهَا فَاسْتَغْفِرُوهُ ثُمَّ تُوبُوا إِلَيْهِ ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي قَرِيبٌ مُجِيبٌ٦١
61. And to Thamud (people We sent) their brother Salih. He said: "O my people! Worship Allah: you have no other god but Him. He brought you forth from the earth and settled you therein, then ask forgiveness of Him and turn to Him in repentance. Certainly, my Lord is Near (to all by His knowledge), Responsive.''

The Story of Salih and the People of Thamud

Allah, the Exalted, says,

﴿و﴾
(And) This is an introduction to that which is implied, "Verily, We sent.''

﴿إِلَى ثَمُودَ﴾
(to Thamud) They were a group of people who were living in cities carved from the rocks, between Tabuk and Al-Madinah (in Arabia). They lived after the people of `Ad, so Allah sent to them,

﴿أَخَاهُمْ صَـلِحاً﴾
(their brother Salih.) He (Salih) commanded them to worship Allah alone. He said to them,

﴿هُوَ أَنشَأَكُمْ مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ﴾
(He brought you forth from the earth) This means: `He began your creation from it (the earth). From it He created your father, Adam.'

﴿وَاسْتَعْمَرَكُمْ فِيهَا﴾
(and settled you therein,) This means: `He made you prosperous in the earth. You are settled in it and you treasure it.'

﴿فَاسْتَغْفِرُوهُ﴾
(then ask forgiveness) `This is in reference to your previous sins. '

﴿ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ﴾
(and turn to Him in repentance.) `This is in reference to the future.'

﴿إِنَّ رَبِّى قَرِيبٌ مُّجِيبٌ﴾
(Certainly, my Lord is Near (to all by His knowledge), Responsive.) This is similar to Allah's statement,

﴿وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ﴾
(And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed Near (to them by My knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me.) ﴿2:186﴾
