Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 57. Al-Hadid, Introduction

Introduction to Hadiid
Which was revealed in Madina
The Virtues of Surat Al-Hadid

Imam Ahmad recorded that `Irbad bin Sariyah said that the Messenger of Allah used to recite Al-Musabbihat before he went to sleep, saying,

«إِنَّ فِيهِنَّ آيَةً أَفْضَلُ مِنْ أَلْفِ آيَة»
(In them there is an Ayah that is better than a thousand Ayat.) Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa'i collected this Hadith; At-Tirmidhi said, "Hasan Gharib.'' The Ayah referred to in this Hadith is -- and Allah knows best --

﴿هُوَ الاٌّوَّلُ وَالاٌّخِرُ وَالظَّـهِرُ وَالْبَـطِنُ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ ﴾
(He is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, Az-Zahir and Al-Batin. And He is the All-Knower of everything.)(57:3) Allah willing, we will again mention this subject. Upon Allah we trust and our total reliance and dependence are on Him, and sufficient He is to us as Supporter and Helper.

﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
