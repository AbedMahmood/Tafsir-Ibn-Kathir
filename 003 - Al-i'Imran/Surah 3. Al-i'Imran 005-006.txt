Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 3. Al-i'Imran, Ayaat 5 To 6

إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَخْفَىٰ عَلَيْهِ شَيْءٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ٥هُوَ الَّذِي يُصَوِّرُكُمْ فِي الْأَرْحَامِ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ ۚ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ٦
5. Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or in the heaven. 6. He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills. None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Almighty, the All-Wise.

Allah states that He has perfect knowledge in the heavens and earth and that nothing in them is hidden from His watch.

﴿هُوَ الَّذِي يُصَوِّرُكُمْ فِي الاٌّرْحَامِ كَيْفَ يَشَآءُ﴾
(He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills.) meaning, He creates you in the wombs as He wills, whether male or female, handsome or otherwise, happy or miserable.

﴿لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ﴾
(La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Almighty, the All-Wise.) meaning, He is the Creator and thus is the only deity worthy of worship, without partners, and His is the perfect might, wisdom and decision. This Ayah refers to the fact that `Isa, son of Mary, is a created servant, just as Allah created the rest of mankind. Allah created `Isa in the womb (of his mother) and shaped him as He willed. Therefore, how could `Isa be divine, as the Christians, may Allah's curses descend on them, claim `Isa was created in the womb and his creation changed from stage to stage, just as Allah said,

﴿يَخْلُقُكُمْ فِى بُطُونِ أُمَّهَـتِكُـمْ خَلْقاً مِّن بَعْدِ خَلْقٍ فِى ظُلُمَـتٍ ثَلَـثٍ﴾
(He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation in three veils of darkness.) ﴿39:6﴾.
