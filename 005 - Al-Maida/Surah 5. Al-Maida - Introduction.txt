Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 5. Al-Maida, Introduction

Introduction to Maa-idah
Which was revealed in Al-Madina
The Virtues of Surat Al-Ma'idah; When It was Revealed

At-Tirmidhi recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, "The last Surahs to be revealed were Surat Al-Ma'idah and Surat Al-Fath (chapter 48).'' At-Tirmidhi commented, "This Hadith is Hasan, Gharib.'' and it was also reported that Ibn `Abbas said that the last Surah to be revealed was,
﴿إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ ﴾
(When there comes the help of Allah and the Conquest,) Al-Hakim collected a narration similar to that of At-Tirmidhi in his Mustadrak, and he said, "It is Sahih according to the criteria of the Two Shaykhs and they did not record it.'' Al-Hakim narrated that Jubayr bin Nufayr said, "I performed Hajj once and visited `A'ishah and she said to me, `O Jubayr! Do you read (or memorize) Al-Ma'idah ' I answered `Yes.' She said, `It was the last Surah to be revealed. Therefore, whatever permissible matters you find in it, then consider (treat) them permissible. And whatever impermissible matters you find in it, then consider (treat) them impermissible.''' Al-Hakim said, "It is Sahih according to the criteria of the Two Shaykhs and they did not record it. '' Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Mahdi related that Mu`awiyah bin Salih added this statement in the last Hadith, "I (Jubayr) also asked `A'ishah about the Messenger of Allah's conduct and she answered by saying, `The Qur'an.''' An-Nasa'i also recorded it.

﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴾
In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.
