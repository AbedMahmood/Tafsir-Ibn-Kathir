Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 12. Yusuf, Ayaat 11 To 12

قَالُوا يَا أَبَانَا مَا لَكَ لَا تَأْمَنَّا عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَنَاصِحُونَ١١أَرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا غَدًا يَرْتَعْ وَيَلْعَبْ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ١٢
11. They said: "O our father! Why do you not trust us with Yusuf though we are indeed his well-wishers'' 12. "Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and verily, we will take care of him.''

Yusuf's Brothers ask for Their Father's Permission to take Yusuf with Them

When Yusuf's brothers agreed to take him and throw him down the well, taking the advice of their elder brother Rubil, they went to their father Ya`qub, peace be upon him. They said to him, "Why is it that you,

﴿لاَ تَأْمَنَّا عَلَى يُوسُفَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَنَـصِحُونَ﴾
(do not trust us with Yusuf though we are indeed his well-wishers).'' They started executing their plan by this introductory statement, even though they really intended its opposite, out of envy towards Yusuf for being loved by his father. They said,

﴿أَرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا﴾
"(Send him with us) tomorrow so that we all enjoy ourselves and play.'' Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said similarly. Yusuf's brothers said next,

﴿وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ﴾
(and verily, we will take care of him.), we will protect him and ensure his safety for you.
