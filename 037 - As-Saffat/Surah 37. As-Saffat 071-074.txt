Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 37. As-Saffat, Ayaat 71 To 74

وَلَقَدْ ضَلَّ قَبْلَهُمْ أَكْثَرُ الْأَوَّلِينَ٧١وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا فِيهِمْ مُنْذِرِينَ٧٢فَانْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَاقِبَةُ الْمُنْذَرِينَ٧٣إِلَّا عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ٧٤
71. And indeed most of the earlier ones went astray before them; 72. And indeed We sent among them warners; 73. Then see what was the end of those who were warned. 74. Except the chosen servants of Allah.) Allah tells us that most of the previous nations went astray, worshipping other gods alongside Allah. He states that He sent among them warners to alert them to the anger, wrath and vengeance of Allah towards those who disbelieve in Him and worship others besides Him. He tells us that they persisted in their opposition to their Messengers and their disbelief in them, so He destroyed those who disbelieved in Him and saved the believers and caused them to prevail. Allah says:

﴿فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُنذَرِينَ إِلاَّ عِبَادَ اللَّهِ الْمُخْلَصِينَ ﴾
(Then see what was the end of those who were warned. Except the chosen servants of Allah).
