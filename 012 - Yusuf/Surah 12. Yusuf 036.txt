وَدَخَلَ مَعَهُ السِّجْنَ فَتَيَانِ ۖ قَالَ أَحَدُهُمَا إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَعْصِرُ خَمْرًا ۖ وَقَالَ الْآخَرُ إِنِّي أَرَانِي أَحْمِلُ فَوْقَ رَأْسِي خُبْزًا تَأْكُلُ الطَّيْرُ مِنْهُ ۖ نَبِّئْنَا بِتَأْوِيلِهِ ۖ إِنَّا نَرَاكَ مِنَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ٣٦
36. And there entered with him two young men in the prison. One of them said: "Verily, I saw myself (in a dream) pressing wine.'' The other said: "Verily, I saw myself (in a dream) carrying bread on my head and birds were eating thereof.'' (They said): "Inform us of the interpretation of this. Verily, we think you are one of the doers of good.''
