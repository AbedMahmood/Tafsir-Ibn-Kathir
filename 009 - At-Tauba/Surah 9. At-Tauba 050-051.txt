Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 9. At-Tauba, Ayaat 50 To 51

إِنْ تُصِبْكَ حَسَنَةٌ تَسُؤْهُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ تُصِبْكَ مُصِيبَةٌ يَقُولُوا قَدْ أَخَذْنَا أَمْرَنَا مِنْ قَبْلُ وَيَتَوَلَّوْا وَهُمْ فَرِحُونَ٥٠قُلْ لَنْ يُصِيبَنَا إِلَّا مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَنَا هُوَ مَوْلَانَا ۚ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ٥١
50. If good befalls you, it grieves them, but if a calamity overtakes you, they say: "We took our precaution beforehand,'' and they turn away rejoicing. 51. Say: "Nothing shall ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is our Mawla (protector).'' And in Allah let the believers put their trust.

Allah emphasizes the enmity that the hypocrites have for the Prophet

If a blessing, such as victory and triumph over the enemies, is given to the Prophet , thus pleasing him and his Companions, it grieves the hypocrites,

﴿وَإِن تُصِبْكَ مُصِيبَةٌ يَقُولُواْ قَدْ أَخَذْنَا أَمْرَنَا مِن قَبْلُ﴾
(but if a calamity overtakes you, they say: "We took our precaution beforehand,''), they say, we took precautions when we did not join him,

﴿وَيَتَوَلَّواْ وَّهُمْ فَرِحُونَ﴾
(and they turn away rejoicing.) Allah directed His Prophet to reply to the perfect enmity they have towards him,

﴿قُلْ﴾
(Say), to them,

﴿لَّن يُصِيبَنَآ إِلاَّ مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَنَا﴾
(Nothing shall ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us.) for we are under His control and decree,

﴿هُوَ مَوْلَـنَا﴾
(He is our Mawla.), Master and protector,

﴿وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ﴾
(And in Allah let the believers put their trust) ﴿9:51﴾, and we trust in Him. Verily, He is sufficient for us and what an excellent guardian.
