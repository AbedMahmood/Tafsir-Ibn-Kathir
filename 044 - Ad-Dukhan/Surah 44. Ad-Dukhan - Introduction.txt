Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 44. Ad-Dukhan, Introduction

Introduction to Dukhaan
Which was revealed in Makkah

In Musnad Al-Bazzar, it is recorded from Abu At-Tufayl `Amir bin Wathilah from Zayd bin Harithah that the Messenger of Allah said to Ibn Sayyad:

«إِنِّي قَدْ خَبَأْتُ خَبْأً فَمَا هُوَ؟»
(I am concealing something, what is it) And the Messenger of Allah was concealing Surat Ad-Dukhan from him. He (Ibn Sayyad) said: "It is Ad-Dukh.'' The Messenger of Allah said,

«اخْسَأْ مَا شَاءَ اللهُ (كَانَ)»
(Be off with you! Whatever Allah wills happens.)

﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ﴾
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
