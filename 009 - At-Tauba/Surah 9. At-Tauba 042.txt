Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 9. At-Tauba, Ayah 42

لَوْ كَانَ عَرَضًا قَرِيبًا وَسَفَرًا قَاصِدًا لَاتَّبَعُوكَ وَلَٰكِنْ بَعُدَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّقَّةُ ۚ وَسَيَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ لَوِ اسْتَطَعْنَا لَخَرَجْنَا مَعَكُمْ يُهْلِكُونَ أَنْفُسَهُمْ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَاذِبُونَ٤٢
42. Had it been a near gain and an easy journey, they would have followed you, but the distance was long for them; and they would swear by Allah: "If we only could, we would certainly have come forth with you.'' They destroy themselves, and Allah knows that they are liars.

Why Hypocrites would not join in Jihad

Allah admonishes those who lagged behind and did not join the Prophet for the battle of Tabuk, those who asked the Prophet for permission to remain behind, falsely pretending to have legitimate reasons to do so,

﴿لَوْ كَانَ عَرَضًا قَرِيبًا﴾
(Had it been a near gain), booty right in front of them, according to Ibn `Abbas,

﴿وَسَفَرًا قَاصِدًا﴾
(and an easy journey), travel for only a short distance,

﴿لاَّتَّبَعُوكَ﴾
(they would have followed you.) But,

﴿وَلَـكِن بَعُدَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الشُّقَّةُ﴾
(the distance was long for them), to Ash-Sham,

﴿وَسَيَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِ﴾
(and they would swear by Allah), when you return to them,

﴿لَوِ اسْتَطَعْنَا لَخَرَجْنَا مَعَكُمْ﴾
(If we only could, we would certainly have come forth with you), had not there been a valid excuse, we would have gone out with you,

﴿يُهْلِكُونَ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّهُمْ لَكَـذِبُونَ﴾
(They destroy themselves, and Allah knows that they are liars.)
