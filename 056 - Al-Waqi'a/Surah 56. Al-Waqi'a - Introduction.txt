Introduction to Waaqi-ah
Which was revealed in Makkah
The Virtues of Surat Al-Waqi`ah

Abu Ishaq reported from `Ikrimah from Ibn `Abbas that Abu Bakr said, "O Allah's Messenger! You are becoming gray'' The Messenger replied,

«شَيَّبَتْنِي هُودٌ وَالْوَاقِعَةُ وَالْمُرْسَلَاتُ وَعَمَّ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ وَإِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَت»
(Hud (chapter 11), Al-Waqi`ah (56), Al-Mursalat (77), `Amma Yatasa'alun (78) and Idha Ash-Shamsu Kuwwirat (81) have made me gray.) At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said, "Hasan Gharib.''

﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ﴾
In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
