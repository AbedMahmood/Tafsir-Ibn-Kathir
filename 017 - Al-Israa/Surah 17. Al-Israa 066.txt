Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 17. Al-Israa, Ayah 66

رَبُّكُمُ الَّذِي يُزْجِي لَكُمُ الْفُلْكَ فِي الْبَحْرِ لِتَبْتَغُوا مِنْ فَضْلِهِ ۚ إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا٦٦
66. Your Lord is He Who drives the ship for you through the sea, in order that you may seek of His bounty. Truly, He is ever Most Merciful towards you.

Ships are a Sign of the Mercy of Allah

Allah tells us of His kindness towards His servants by subjugating for them ships on the sea. He makes it easy for them to use ships to serve their interests, seeking His bounty through trade between one region and another. He says:

﴿إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا﴾
(Truly, He is ever Most Merciful towards you.) meaning, He does this for you out of His grace and mercy towards you.
