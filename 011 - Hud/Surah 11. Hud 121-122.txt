Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 11. Hud, Ayaat 121 To 122

وَقُلْ لِلَّذِينَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ اعْمَلُوا عَلَىٰ مَكَانَتِكُمْ إِنَّا عَامِلُونَ١٢١وَانْتَظِرُوا إِنَّا مُنْتَظِرُونَ١٢٢
121. And say to those who do not believe: "Act according to your ability and way, We are acting. 122. And you wait! We (too) are waiting.''

Allah, the Exalted, commands His Messenger to say to those who disbelieve in what he has come ...

﴿اعْمَلُواْ عَلَى مَكَانَتِكُمْ﴾
(Act according to your ability) This means upon your path and your way.

﴿إِنَّا عَامِلُونَ﴾
(We are acting (in our way). This means that we are upon our path and our way (Islam).

﴿وَانْتَظِرُواْ إِنَّا مُنتَظِرُونَ ﴾
(And you wait ! We (too) are waiting.) This means,

﴿فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ مَن تَكُونُ لَهُ عَـقِبَةُ الدَّارِ إِنَّهُ لاَ يُفْلِحُ الظَّـلِمُونَ﴾
(And you will come to know for which of us will be the (happy) end in the Hereafter. Certainly the wrongdoers will not be successful.)﴿6:135﴾ Verily, Allah fulfilled His promise to His Messenger , helped him and aided him. He made His Word uppermost (victorious), and the word of those who disbelieved lowly and disgraced. Allah is truly the Most Mighty, Most Wise.
