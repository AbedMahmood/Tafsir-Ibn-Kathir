Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 16. An-Nahl, Ayaat 110 To 111

ثُمَّ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لِلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا فُتِنُوا ثُمَّ جَاهَدُوا وَصَبَرُوا إِنَّ رَبَّكَ مِنْ بَعْدِهَا لَغَفُورٌ رَحِيمٌ١١٠۞ يَوْمَ تَأْتِي كُلُّ نَفْسٍ تُجَادِلُ عَنْ نَفْسِهَا وَتُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَا عَمِلَتْ وَهُمْ لَا يُظْلَمُونَ١١١
110. Then, verily, your Lord for those who emigrated after they were put to trials and then performed Jihad, and were patient, - after this, your Lord is indeed Forgiving, Most Merciful. 111. (Remember) the Day when every person will come pleading for himself, and every one will be paid in full for what he did, and they will not be dealt with unjustly.

The One who is forced to renounce Islam will be forgiven if He does Righteous Deeds afterwards

This refers to another group of people who were oppressed in Makkah and whose position with their own people was weak, so they went along with them when they were tried by them. Then they managed to escape by emigrating, leaving their homeland, families and wealth behind, seeking the pleasure and forgiveness of Allah. They joined the believers and fought with them against the disbelievers, bearing hardship with patience. Allah tells them that after this, meaning after their giving in when put to the test, He will forgive them and show mercy to them when they are resurrected.

﴿يَوْمَ تَأْتِى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ تُجَـدِلُ﴾
((Remember) the Day when every person will come pleading) meaning making a case in his own defence.

﴿عَن نَّفْسِهَا﴾
(for himself.) means, no one else will plead on his behalf; not his father, not his son, nor his brother, nor his wife.

﴿وَتُوَفَّى كُلُّ نَفْسٍ مَّا عَمِلَتْ﴾
(and every one will be paid in full for what he did,) meaning whatever he did, good or evil.

﴿وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ﴾
(and they will not be dealt with unjustly.) meaning there will be no decrease in the reward for good, and no increase in the punishment for evil. They will not be dealt with unjustly in the slightest way.
