Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 7. Al-A'raf, Ayaat 13 To 15

قَالَ فَاهْبِطْ مِنْهَا فَمَا يَكُونُ لَكَ أَنْ تَتَكَبَّرَ فِيهَا فَاخْرُجْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الصَّاغِرِينَ١٣قَالَ أَنْظِرْنِي إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ١٤قَالَ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الْمُنْظَرِينَ١٥
13. (Allah) said: "(O Iblis) get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out, for you are of those humiliated and disgraced.'' 14. (Iblis) said: "Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (the Day of Resurrection).'' 15. (Allah) said: "You are of those respited.'') Allah ordered Iblis;

﴿فَاهْبِطْ مِنْهَا﴾
(Get down from this) "because you defied My command and disobeyed Me. Get out, it is not for you to be arrogant here,'' in Paradise, according to the scholars of Tafsir. It could also refer to particular status which he held in the utmost highs. Allah said to Iblis,

﴿فَاخْرُجْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الصَّـغِرِينَ﴾
(Get out, for you are of those humiliated and disgraced.) as just recompense for his ill intentions, by giving him the opposite of what he intended (arrogance). This is when the cursed one remembered and asked for respite until the Day of Judgment,

﴿قَالَ رَبِّ فَأَنظِرْنِى إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ - قَالَ فَإِنَّكَ مِنَ الْمُنظَرِينَ ﴾
(Then allow me respite till the Day they are raised up. (Allah) said: "Then you are of those respited.'') ﴿15: 36-37﴾ Allah gave Shaytan what he asked for out of His wisdom, being His decision and decree, that is never prevented or resisted. Surely, none can avert His decision, and He is swift in reckoning.
