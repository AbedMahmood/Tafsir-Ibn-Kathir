Introduction to Infitaar
Which was revealed in Makkah
The Virtues of Surat Al-Infitar

An-Nasa'i recorded from Jabir that Mu`adh stood and lead the people in the Night prayer, and he made the recitation of his prayer long. So the Prophet said,

«أَفَتَّانٌ أَنْتَ يَا مُعَاذُ؟ أَيْنَ كُنْتَ عَنْ
﴿سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الاّعْلَى ﴾
﴿وَالضُّحَى ﴾وَ
﴿إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انفَطَرَتْ ﴾»
(Are you putting the people to trial O Mu`adh Why don't you recite (Glorify the Name of your Lord the Most High) (87), (By the forenoon) (93), and (When the heaven is cleft asunder) (82))'' The basis of this Hadith is found in the Two Sahihs, however the mentioning of

﴿إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انفَطَرَتْ ﴾
(When the heaven is cleft asunder.) has only been mentioned by An-Nasa'i. It has been previously mentioned in a narration from `Abdullah bin `Umar that the Prophet said,

«مَنْ سَرَّهُ أَنْ يَنْظُرَ إِلَى الْقِيَامَةِ رَأْيَ عَيْنٍ فَلْيَقْرَأْ:
﴿إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ ﴾و
﴿إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انفَطَرَتْ ﴾و
﴿إِذَا السَّمَآءُ انشَقَّتْ ﴾»
(Whoever would be pleased to look at the Day of Resurrection with his own eyes, then let him recite, (When the sun is Kuwwirat.) (81) and; (When the heaven is cleft asunder) (82) and; (When the heaven is split asunder) (84).)

﴿بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ
(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
