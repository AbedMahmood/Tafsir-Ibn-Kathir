Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 19. Maryam, Ayah 76

وَيَزِيدُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ اهْتَدَوْا هُدًى ۗ وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ مَرَدًّا٧٦
76. And Allah increases in guidance those who walk aright. And the righteous good deeds that last are better with your Lord for reward and better for resort.

Increasing Guidance of Those Who are guided

After Allah mentions the extended time and respite that is allowed to those who are in misguidance, increasing them in misguidance, He informs of the increase in guidance of those who are rightly guided. Similarly He says,

﴿وَإِذَا مَآ أُنزِلَتْ سُورَةٌ فَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ أَيُّكُمْ زَادَتْهُ هَـذِهِ إِيمَـناً﴾
(And whenever there comes down a Surah, some of them say: "Which of you has had his faith increased by it'') ﴿9:124﴾ And the following Ayah also shows this. Concerning Allah's statement,

﴿وَالْبَـقِيَاتُ الصَّـلِحَاتُ﴾
(And the righteous good deeds that last) Its explanation has already preceded in Surat Al-Kahf, along with a lengthy discussion concerning it and the related Hadiths.

﴿خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا﴾
((they) are better with your Lord for reward.) meaning the recompense and reward.

﴿وَخَيْرٌ مَّرَدّاً﴾
(and better for resort.) meaning in the final outcome, the result for its doer.
