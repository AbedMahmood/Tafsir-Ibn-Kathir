Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 7. Al-A'raf, Ayah 82

وَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلَّا أَنْ قَالُوا أَخْرِجُوهُمْ مِنْ قَرْيَتِكُمْ ۖ إِنَّهُمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ٨٢
82. And the answer of his people was only that they said: "Drive them out of your town, these are indeed men who want to be pure (from sins)!'') So they answered Prophet Lut by trying to expel and banish him from their village, along with those who believed with him. Allah indeed removed Prophet Lut safely from among them, and He destroyed them in their land in disgrace and humiliation. They said (about Lut and the believers):

﴿إِنَّهُمْ أُنَاسٌ يَتَطَهَّرُونَ﴾
("These are indeed men who want to be pure (from sins)!'') Qatadah commented, "They shamed them (Lut and the believers) with what is not a shame at all.'' Mujahid commented, "(Lut's people said about Lut and the believers,) They are a people who want to be pure from men's anuses and women's anuses!'' Similar was narrated from Ibn `Abbas.
