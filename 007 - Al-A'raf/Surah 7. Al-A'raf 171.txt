Tafsir Ibn Kathir- Surah 7. Al-A'raf, Ayah 171

۞ وَإِذْ نَتَقْنَا الْجَبَلَ فَوْقَهُمْ كَأَنَّهُ ظُلَّةٌ وَظَنُّوا أَنَّهُ وَاقِعٌ بِهِمْ خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ بِقُوَّةٍ وَاذْكُرُوا مَا فِيهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ١٧١
171. And (remember) when We Nataqna the mountain over them as if it had been a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall on them. (We said): "Hold firmly to what We have given you ﴿the Tawrah﴾, and remember that which is therein (act on its commandments), so that you may fear Allah and obey Him.''

Raising Mount Tur over the Jews, because of Their Rebellion

`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on the Ayah,

﴿وَإِذ نَتَقْنَا الْجَبَلَ فَوْقَهُمْ﴾
(And (remember) when We Nataqna the mountain over them), "We raised the mountain, as Allah's other statement testifies,

﴿وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَهُمُ الطُّورَ بِمِيثَـقِهِمْ﴾
(And for their covenant, We raised over them the mountain) ﴿4:154﴾.'' Also, Sufyan Ath-Thawri narrated that Al-A`mash said that, Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said, "The angels raised the Mount over their heads, as reiterated by Allah's statement,

﴿وَرَفَعْنَا فَوْقَهُمُ الطُّورَ﴾
(We raised over them the mountain) ﴿4:154﴾.'' Al-Qasim bin Abi Ayyub narrated that Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said, "Musa later on proceeded with them to the Sacred Land. He took along the Tablets, after his anger subsided, and commanded them to adhere to the orders that Allah ordained to be delivered to them. But these orders became heavy on them and they did not want to implement them until Allah raised the mountain over them,

﴿كَأَنَّهُ ظُلَّةٌ﴾
(as if it had been a canopy), that is, when the angels raised the mountain over their heads.'' An-Nasa'i collected it.
